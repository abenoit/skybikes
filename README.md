## Technical choices

### VanillaJS

I did not use any framework in this project.
I just used some libraries to help me with the packaging, development server, templating etc. - see below.

### Webpack

### Babel

### SCSS

### Templating

Useful to pass data from Javascript to the HTML.

### Material UI library
